The provided C++ program offers a comprehensive implementation of a basic banking system, showcasing fundamental concepts of programming such as file I/O, exception handling, and enum usage. The idea likely stemmed from a pedagogical need to illustrate practical application of these concepts within a familiar context. The program's structure revolves around providing users with a menu-driven interface to create accounts, log in, and perform banking operations including balance inquiries, deposits, and withdrawals. This structure facilitates user interaction and allows for seamless navigation through the system's functionalities.Central to the program's functionality are the `MenuOption` and `LoginOption` enums, which delineate the available choices for users at various stages of interaction. These enums serve as an intuitive way to represent menu options and account operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Additionally, the program utilizes global variables to store user data, such as first name, last name, username, password, phone number, and account balance. These variables are manipulated within functions like `CreateAccount` and `Login`, enabling the program to manage user accounts and transactions effectively.File I/O operations play a pivotal role in the program's functionality, allowing user account information to be stored and retrieved from a text file named "User Data.txt". This enables persistent storage of user data across program executions, ensuring continuity and convenience for users. Moreover, the program employs exception handling mechanisms to gracefully manage runtime errors, such as file opening failures or invalid user input. This enhances the program's robustness and reliability, providing users with a seamless banking experience.In summary, the C++ program encapsulates a simplified yet functional banking system, demonstrating key programming concepts such as enum usage, file I/O, and exception handling. Through its structured approach to user interaction and data management, the program offers a practical illustration of programming principles within a real-world scenario, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex software development projects.
